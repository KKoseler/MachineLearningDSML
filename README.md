# MachineLearningDSML
Initial code generation for an extant but untested DSML for Machine Learning

Specifically, a DSML defined by Breuker (2014) that is built on top of the Infer.NET C# library.
This library allows the user to define a Probabilistic Graphical Model through code and to run inference
algorithms on the model. My code generation engine is targeted towards a Baseball Analytics use case,
specifically the problem of predicting the next pitch as explored by Ganeshapillai & Guttag (2012).
